The mooring was deployed in August 2020 and retrieved in August 2021. Measurements frequency is 1/1 hr for the hydrography. At 800 m and 1200 m nominal depth, the pressure has been calculated based on distance between the SBE sensors. Uncalibrated and quality-controlled values are provided, with their corresponding QC flags. QC flags from EuroSITES (OceanSITES) are used for all data, where flag 0 is used for raw data (unknown, no QC was performed) and flag 2-4 are used for data that have been QD-ed.
