The pCO2 was converted to fCO2 by using SBE temperature and pressure data from the carbon sensor.  Furthermore	 the post processed pCO2 data have been compared to discrete fCO2 data	 which were calculated from discrete DIC and TA data. Discrete DIC and TA samples were collected at 4 cruises over the period when the mooring was deployed (Aug 2020 - Jul 2021).  The carbon sensor data was corrected by subtracting 19.92 uatm from the sensor fCO2 data."
